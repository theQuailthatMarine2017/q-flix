# q-fliqs

Q Flix is a movie streaming web application build using Vuejs and Nodejs and MongoDB database.
I hosted the web application on my own server using port forwarding on my router to allow internet users to access the service
I also intergrated mpesa payments but never went live.

It allows user to view content on a subscription basis.
